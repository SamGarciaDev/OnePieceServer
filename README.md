# About
This project is the back-end server for the [OnePieceApp](https://github.com/SamGarciaIGF/OnePieceApp). It's based on [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-modern-android-app-with-rest-api-and-ktor-server), although I didn't follow it to the letter.

It's a REST API built using Ktor. It uses the following stack:

 - **Ktor**: Kotlin asynchronous server framework.
 - **Koin**: for dependency injection.
 - **AssertJ**: for test assertions.
 - **Mockito**: for mocking.
 - **Exposed**: Kotlin SQL framework.
 - **PostgreSQL**: DB driver.
